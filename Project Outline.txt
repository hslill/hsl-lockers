### Interpretation of Your Request:

You are building a **"Book Locker Notification and Pickup System"** using JavaScript for both staff (backend) and recipients (frontend). Here's how I understand your requirements:

---

#### **1. Backend (Staff Interface)**

1. **Customizable Email Notification:**
   - A form that allows staff to input recipient information and book details.
   - The email contains:
     - Recipient's name.
     - Book details (title, author, etc.).
     - Transaction Number (TN) and associated barcode.
     - Pickup instructions for using the kiosk and retrieving the book.
     - The option to customize the instructional text.

2. **Transaction Number (TN) Management:**
   - A 7-digit TN is generated or input manually by staff to identify the book locker.

3. **Barcode Generation:**
   - The barcode is generated dynamically from the TN.
   - The barcode uses the 3of9 font and is displayed in the email.

4. **Email Submission:**
   - A submit button triggers the email to the recipient with the generated TN and barcode.

5. **Pickup-Page Editing:**
   - A separate staff interface allows customization of the kiosk message displayed to recipients when they scan/enter their TN.

#### **2. Frontend (Recipient Interface)**

1. **Pickup Form:**
   - A form with an input field for the recipient to scan or manually enter their TN.
   - A submit button processes the TN and:
     - Looks up the corresponding locker number and 4-digit combination.
     - Displays a customized pickup message.

2. **Pickup Page:**
   - Displays the locker number and combination.
   - Includes a mechanism to reset the kiosk to the initial "Enter Transaction Number" page for the next user.

### Requirements

#### **Technical Requirements**

1. **Development Tools:**
   - **Editor:** Microsoft Visual Studio.
   - **Server:** A local server (e.g., Node.js or a lightweight server like WAMP/XAMPP).

2. **Frontend:**
   - HTML, CSS for forms and layout.
   - JavaScript for barcode generation, email integration, and kiosk functionality.

3. **Backend:**
   - JavaScript for email customization and submission.
   - An SMTP email service (e.g., NodeMailer or an API like SendGrid) for sending the notification emails.
   - LocalStorage or a database (e.g., SQLite) to manage TNs and their associated locker details.

4. **Barcode Font:**
   - Include 3of9 barcode font in the email or use a barcode library like `JsBarcode` for dynamic rendering.

5. **Deployment:**
   - Run the application on a local server for testing.
   - If the kiosk interface is web-based, ensure the page can reset to its initial state after each interaction.

### Implementation Plan

#### **Step 1: Backend Development**

1. Create an HTML form for staff to:
   - Input recipient name, book details, and TN.
   - Generate and preview the email.
   - Submit the email using an email-sending library.

2. Implement barcode generation using:
   - `JsBarcode` (to render barcodes dynamically as images).
   - Or embed 3of9 font for rendering.

3. Add functionality to:
   - Customize the kiosk pickup page message.
   - Save the locker number and combination with the TN for lookup.

---

#### **Step 2: Frontend Development**

1. Develop the recipient interface with:
   - An input field for TN.
   - A submit button that looks up locker details and displays the pickup message.

2. Implement the kiosk interface:
   - Show the locker number and combination.
   - Reset to the initial TN input screen after each use.

---

#### **Step 3: Testing and Deployment**

1. Test the functionality locally:
   - Verify email generation and submission.
   - Ensure barcode renders correctly and is scannable.
   - Test kiosk functionality for multiple TNs.

2. Deploy on a local server:
   - Ensure all dependencies are included (e.g., email libraries, barcode font).
